    "### Running Distributed Tasks using Delayed\n",
    "The `delayed` decorator is one of the simplest ways to run tasks using dask-distributed. Applying the decorator to a function, or wrapping a particular call to the function with `delayed` returns a task, which can be evaluated using `compute`. `compute` automatically connects to the distributed scheduler, serving tasks to each worker. In the following example, each task has been slowed down using `time.sleep`, so that it is easier to see what is going on in the console, which can be found at http://localhost:8787/status in real time."
